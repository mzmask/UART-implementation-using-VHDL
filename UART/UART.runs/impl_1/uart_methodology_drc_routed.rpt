2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks Clk and Clk200 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks Clk] -to [get_clocks Clk200]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks Clk200 and Clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks Clk200] -to [get_clocks Clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks Clk and Clk200 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks Clk] -to [get_clocks Clk200]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning
No common node between related clocks
